worlds:
  # Worlds can be handled by templates, based on world type
  # You can override the properties of the template by specifying them in this section
  #    for example 'Title: "My Awesome World"'
  - name: world
    title: "ASTRAWORLD"
    extrazoomout: 3
    maps:
      - class: org.dynmap.hdmap.HDMap
        name: flat
        title: "Flat"
        prefix: flat
        perspective: iso_S_90_lowres
        shader: stdtexture
        lighting: shadows
        mapzoomin: 1
  # To just label world, and inherit rest from template, just provide name and title
  #- name: world2
  #  title: "Second World"
  #
  #- name: nether
  #  title: "Nether"
  #  center:
  #    x: 0
